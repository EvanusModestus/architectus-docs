[.lead]
From intermediate to mastery — a documented journey.

== Current Level: B2

Achieved B2 (CEFR) proficiency. Now working toward C1 and ultimately C2.

== The Goal: C2

C2 represents mastery:

* Understanding virtually everything heard or read
* Expressing oneself spontaneously, fluently, and precisely
* Differentiating finer shades of meaning in complex situations

== Method

=== Immersion Through Literature

* Reading: _{book-quijote}_, {author-gabo}, {book-rv}
* No translation — dictionary only when necessary
* Note-taking in Spanish

=== Active Production

* Writing in Spanish (journal, notes, documentation)
* Speaking with native speakers
* Teaching others (solidifies knowledge)

=== Formal Study

* DELE/SIELE preparation materials
* Grammar deep-dives
* Vocabulary expansion (academic, literary, colloquial)
