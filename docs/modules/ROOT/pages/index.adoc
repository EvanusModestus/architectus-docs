== Philosophy

This site represents the intersection of technical mastery and humanistic depth. Technology alone is insufficient. Literature, mathematics, music, and philosophy provide the foundation for wisdom.

=== Why "Architectus"?

The master builder doesn't just execute — they design, understand structure, and see patterns across domains.

=== Bilingual / Bilingüe

This site is available in both English and Spanish. Much of the literature section is in Spanish, reflecting the source texts.
