== Philosophy

This site represents the intersection of technical mastery and humanistic depth. Technology alone is insufficient. Literature, mathematics, music, and philosophy provide the foundation for wisdom.

=== Why "Architectus"?

The master builder doesn't just execute — they design, they understand structure, they see patterns across domains:

* **Technology**: Building systems that are secure, resilient, and elegant
* **Literature**: Understanding the architecture of narrative and meaning
* **Mathematics**: Grasping the architecture of logic and proof
* **Music**: Constructing architecture in sound
* **Languages**: Bridging architectures of thought between cultures

=== Bilingual / Bilingüe

This site is available in both English and Spanish. Much of the literature section is in Spanish, reflecting the source texts.
