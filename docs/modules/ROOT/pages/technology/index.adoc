== Approach

Every guide here follows these principles:

1. **Vendor-agnostic concepts first** — understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Vendor-specific implementation** — real commands, real configs
3. **Verification steps** — always confirm before and after changes
4. **Security by default** — TLS, least privilege, audit logging

== Coming Soon

This section will expand to include:

* Linux EAP-TLS methodology
* Network segmentation patterns
* PKI architecture design
* Automation frameworks
* Cloud security posture
