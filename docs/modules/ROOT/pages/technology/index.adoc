== Approach

Every guide follows these principles:

1. **Vendor-agnostic concepts first** — understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Vendor-specific implementation** — real commands, real configs
3. **Verification steps** — always confirm before and after changes
4. **Security by default** — TLS, least privilege, audit logging

== Structure

Technology content is organized by domain. Each domain contains:

* **Concepts** — foundational understanding
* **Guides** — step-by-step procedures
* **References** — quick lookup tables, command cheatsheets
* **Troubleshooting** — common issues and solutions
