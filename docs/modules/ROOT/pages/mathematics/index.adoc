Mathematics as the language of pattern and structure.

== Philosophy

Mathematics is not merely calculation — it is the study of structure itself. The same patterns appear in:

* Network topology
* Musical harmony
* Logical proof
* System architecture

Understanding mathematics deepens understanding everywhere.
