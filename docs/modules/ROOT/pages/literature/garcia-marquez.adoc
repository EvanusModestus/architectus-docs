Nobel laureate, master of magical realism, voice of Latin America.

== The Author

Gabriel García Márquez (1927-2014), known as "Gabo," was a Colombian novelist, journalist, and Nobel Prize winner (1982). His work blends the magical with the mundane, history with myth.

== Major Works

=== {book-cien-anos} (1967)

The founding text of magical realism. Seven generations of the Buendía family in the mythical town of Macondo. Time is circular, history repeats, solitude is destiny.

[quote, {author-gabo}, {book-cien-anos}]
____
Muchos años después, frente al pelotón de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo.
____

=== {book-amor-tiempos} (1985)

Love that spans fifty years. The persistence of passion against time, convention, and death itself.

=== {book-cronica} (1981)

A murder foretold, yet unstoppable. The mechanics of fate, honor, and collective guilt.

== Themes

=== Solitude (Soledad)

The defining condition of the Buendía family — and perhaps of Latin America itself. Solitude as both curse and consequence.

=== Time

Linear time is an illusion. The past is present, the future is past, and everything that will happen has already happened.

=== Magic in the Mundane

Ice is magical to those who have never seen it. The "magical" in magical realism is often just reality seen with fresh eyes.
