_{book-quijote}_ — the first modern novel, and an inexhaustible source of wisdom.

== The Work

Published in two parts (1605, 1615), Don Quijote tells the story of a man who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his grip on reality — or perhaps gains a grip on a deeper reality.

== Key Themes

=== Identity

[quote, Don Quijote]
____
{quote-quijote-identity}
____

Who are we? Who can we become? Quijote asserts his identity against a world that sees him as mad. Yet his madness is often wiser than the sanity of those who mock him.

=== Idealism vs. Reality

The windmills are not giants. But is it better to see windmills or to see giants? Cervantes never fully answers this question — he lets it haunt the reader.

=== The Power of Stories

Quijote is transformed by the books he reads. He becomes proof that stories shape reality, that imagination has power over matter.
