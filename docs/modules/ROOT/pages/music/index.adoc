Music as structured time — architecture in sound.

== Philosophy

Music is mathematics made audible. The same principles that govern harmonious systems govern harmonious sound:

* **Structure** — Form, repetition, variation
* **Tension and resolution** — Dissonance to consonance
* **Layering** — Melody, harmony, rhythm, timbre
* **Time** — Duration, tempo, meter
