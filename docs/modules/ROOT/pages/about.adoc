[.lead]
Senior infrastructure security engineer building systems that work.

== What I Do

I design and secure enterprise infrastructure—the kind that has to work at 3 AM when nobody's watching.

|*Network Security*
|802.1X, NAC, zero-trust segmentation, firewall architecture

|*Identity & Access*
|PKI, certificate lifecycle, RADIUS, Active Directory integration

|*Automation*
|Python, PowerShell, Bash, Terraform, infrastructure as code

|*Platform Engineering*
|CI/CD pipelines, multi-forge strategies, docs-as-code

== Why This Site Exists

Documentation should be treated like code—versioned, tested, and maintained.

This site aggregates knowledge across 14 repositories using Antora's hub-spoke architecture. Content deploys automatically to Cloudflare Pages via GitHub Actions and GitLab CI. The same source builds to multiple forges for redundancy.

It's also a personal forcing function. Writing clarifies thinking. Publishing creates accountability.

== Beyond the Terminal

Technology is one lens among many. This site also explores:

* *Literature* — Spanish Golden Age, Latin American magical realism, sacred texts
* *Mathematics* — Pattern recognition, foundational understanding
* *Music* — Theory, composition, the architecture of sound
* *Languages* — Spanish fluency, bridging cultures through words

== Principles

* *Excellence as discipline* — Doing things well because the work deserves it
* *Integration over fragmentation* — Finding connections across domains
* *Generosity of knowledge* — What I learn, I share
* *Humility before complexity* — There's always more to understand
