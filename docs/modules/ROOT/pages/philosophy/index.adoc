:navtitle: Philosophy

[.lead]
The foundation beneath the foundation.

== Worldview

Technology, literature, mathematics, music — these are expressions of something deeper. This section explores that foundation.

== Core Convictions

=== Faith and Reason

Faith and reason are not enemies. The same God who created the universe created the mind that explores it. To think well is an act of worship.

=== Excellence as Worship

Whatever you do, do it well. Not for recognition, but because excellence honors the Creator of excellence.

[quote, Colossians 3:23 (Reina Valera)]
____
Y todo lo que hagáis, hacedlo de corazón, como para el Señor y no para los hombres.
____

=== Integration Over Fragmentation

The modern world fragments knowledge into silos. But truth is unified. Technology, art, science, faith — these are different windows into the same reality.

=== Generosity of Knowledge

Knowledge hoarded is knowledge wasted. Share freely what you've learned freely.

== Influences

* **Scripture** — The {book-rv} as foundation
* **Augustine** — Faith seeking understanding
* **Aquinas** — The harmony of reason and revelation
* **Cervantes** — The power of ideals against cynicism
* **García Márquez** — The weight of history and mystery of time

== Purpose of This Site

This site exists to:

1. **Document** — Capture what I learn before it's forgotten
2. **Share** — Help others who walk similar paths
3. **Integrate** — Show that technical mastery and humanistic depth belong together
4. **Witness** — Demonstrate that faith produces, not hinders, excellence
